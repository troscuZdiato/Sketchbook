# How to Use Dynamic .NET TWAIN to Scan and Capture Images from Scanners and Webcams
 
Dynamic .NET TWAIN is a document imaging SDK that allows you to easily integrate scanning and webcam capture functionality into your .NET desktop applications. It supports various scanner drivers, such as TWAIN, ICA, SANE and eSCL, and various image formats, such as PDF, TIFF, JPEG and PNG. In this article, we will show you how to use Dynamic .NET TWAIN to scan and capture images from scanners and webcams in C# and VB.NET.

## Prerequisites
 
To use Dynamic .NET TWAIN, you need to have the following:
 
- A Windows operating system (Windows 7 or later)
- A .NET Framework (2.0 or 4.0)
- A Visual Studio IDE (2010 or later)
- A scanner or a webcam device
- A license key for Dynamic .NET TWAIN (you can get a free trial key [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/dotnet-twain/download/))

## Installation
 
To install Dynamic .NET TWAIN, you can either use the MSI installer or the NuGet package manager. The MSI installer will install the SDK components and sample projects on your computer. The NuGet package manager will download and reference the SDK assemblies in your project.
 
To use the MSI installer, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the installer from [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/dotnet-twain/download/).
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. After installation, you can find the SDK components in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Dynamsoft\Dynamic .NET TWAIN Version\` and the sample projects in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Dynamsoft\Dynamic .NET TWAIN Version\Samples\`.

To use the NuGet package manager, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new .NET project in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click on the project name and select `Manage NuGet Packages...`.
3. Search for `Dynamsoft.DotNet.TWAIN` and install it.
4. The SDK assemblies will be added to your project references automatically.

## Scanning Images from Scanners
 
To scan images from scanners using Dynamic .NET TWAIN, you need to use the `DynamicDotNetTwain` class, which represents the main control of the SDK. You can drag and drop it from the toolbox to your form design, or create it programmatically in your code.
 
The `DynamicDotNetTwain` class provides various methods and properties for scanning images, such as `SelectSource()`, `SelectSourceByIndex()`, `OpenSource()`, `AcquireImage()`, `CloseSource()`, `IfShowUI`, `IfFeederEnabled`, etc. You can refer to the [API reference](https://www.dynamsoft.com/help/DotNet-TWAIN/index.html) for more details.
 
Here is an example of scanning images from scanners in C#:
  ```csharp using System; using System.Windows.Forms; using Dynamsoft.DotNet.TWAIN;  namespace ScanExample {     public partial class Form1 : Form     {         // Create a DynamicDotNetTwain object         private DynamicDotNetTwain dynamicDotNetTwain1 = null;          public Form1()                      InitializeComponent();              // Initialize the DynamicDotNetTwain object             dynamicDotNetTwain1 = new DynamicDotNetTwain();             dynamicDotNetTwain1.IfThrowException = true;             dynamicDotNetTwain1.LicenseKeys = "Your license key here";             dynamicDotNetTwain1.Parent = this;             dynamicDotNetTwain1.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;                   private 0f148eb4a0
